        <h2>Jin-Ho Yoo</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Yoo Jin-Ho is Jin-Woo's best friend. Jin-Ho is fiercely loyal toward Jin-Woo and seems to have a desire to make his own living, which likely stems from his high-society background. A running gag to his character is his odd habit of dressing up in very flamboyant and expensive armor whenever he goes on raids.</p>
