                    <p>Yoo Jin-Ho is Jin-Woo's best friend. 
                        Jin-Ho is fiercely loyal toward Jin-Woo and seems to have a desire to make his own living, which likely stems from his high-society background. 
                        A running gag to his character is his odd habit of dressing up in very flamboyant and expensive armor whenever he goes on raids.</p>
