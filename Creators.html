                    <p>Chugong is the pseudonym of the South Korean author who wrote the "Solo Leveling" web novel. 
                        Not much is publicly known about Chugong's personal life, as he prefers to keep his identity private. Chugong began publishing "Solo Leveling" on the KakaoPage platform in 2016, where it quickly gained a massive following due to its engaging storytelling and unique take on the dungeon crawler genre.</p>
